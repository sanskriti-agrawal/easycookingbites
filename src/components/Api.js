        making:'Step 1: To prepare this popular dish, soak sabut urad and rajma overnight in three cups of water. Drain it and pressure cook in 6 cups of water with salt as per taste. This makes the rajma and dal soft. step2: Take a kadhai on medium flame, then heat the oil and add the cumin seeds. Once the cumin seeds crackle, you can add half the ginger-garlic paste and stir for some time. Then add some onions, chopped green chillies and tomato puree. Fry until the mix turns golden. If you are someone who loves the authentic style of Dal Makhani, then we suggest you to use ghee instead of oil. step3: Once the bhuna masala is ready you can add the pressure cooked Rajma and dal, and bring to a boil. If you want your Dal Makhani to be smooth, you can grind the masala first and then add the dal and Rajma. step 4: Then add garam masala and salt as per your taste. Stir well and bring to boil, if you think that the dal is too thick, you can add some water. Then add some fresh cream to this recipe and stir well. This will make your Dal Makhani creamy and delicious. Garnish this recipe with fresh cream and freshly chopped coriander leaves.'
